### Assumptions and Trade-Offs in Designing and Implementing the Rate Limiting Solution

#### Assumptions

1. **API Key Uniqueness**:
    - It is assumed that each API key is unique and corresponds to a single user or client. This ensures that the rate limiting can be effectively managed per user.
    - If API keys were shared among multiple users, the rate limit could be unintentionally exceeded quickly.

2. **Fixed Rate Limit**:
    - The rate limit is fixed at 5 requests per hour per API key. It assumes this rate is appropriate for the typical usage patterns and prevents abuse while allowing legitimate usage.
    - This might not be suitable for all scenarios, especially for users needing higher request rates.

#### Trade-Offs

1. **Scalability vs. Complexity**:
    - **Trade-Off**: Using an in-memory token bucket for rate limiting simplifies implementation and ensures low latency, but it may not scale well across multiple instances of the service.
    - **Alternative**: A distributed rate limiting solution using Redis or a similar technology could be more scalable but would add complexity and potential latency.

2. **Fixed Rate Limiting vs. Dynamic Rate Limiting**:
    - **Trade-Off**: Fixed rate limits are easy to implement and understand but may not accommodate varying user needs effectively.
    - **Alternative**: Dynamic rate limiting based on user profiles or usage patterns could be more user-friendly but is more complex to implement and maintain.

3. **Memory Usage vs. Persistence**:
    - **Trade-Off**: The in-memory token bucket approach consumes memory and requires that the service retains state, potentially leading to higher memory usage.
    - **Alternative**: Storing the rate limit state in a persistent store (e.g., database) would reduce memory usage but could introduce latency and complexity.

4. **Rate Limiting at Filter Level vs. Endpoint Level**:
    - **Trade-Off**: Implementing rate limiting at the filter level ensures consistent application across all endpoints but can make debugging and monitoring more challenging.
    - **Alternative**: Implementing rate limiting at the endpoint level could provide more granular control and easier debugging but requires more repetitive code.

5. **Error Message Specificity vs. Security**:
    - **Trade-Off**: Providing detailed error messages (e.g., specifying that the rate limit has been exceeded) helps users understand the issue but can reveal usage patterns.
    - **Alternative**: Generic error messages enhance security but may lead to user confusion and frustration.

6. **Dependency on External Service**:
    - **Trade-Off**: Relying on the OpenWeatherMap API means the service is dependent on the availability and reliability of the external API.
    - **Alternative**: Caching weather data could reduce dependency on the external API but introduces complexity in cache management and potential data staleness.
